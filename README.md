To pet the dog, press the controller button corresponding to the location: left
for head, up for back, right for butt, down for tummy. The highlighted blue
arrow indicates where the dog wants pets. Players score 1 point for petting the
right location and lose 1 point for petting another location. At the end of 20
seconds, the player with the most points and the dog both win; the dog always
wins because it got lots of good pets. Player 1 may press "A" to play again.
